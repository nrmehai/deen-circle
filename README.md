## Problem Statement And Solution Approach

### **Problem Statement**
In Ramadan, we have the blessing to be able to see numerous of our beloved Brothers and Sisters. But after this blessed month passes, there is a feeling disconnect that starts to ooze. Deen Circle is an app where we wish to ignite this feeling of Brotherhood even after Ramadan by letting Muslims know what events are going on in their local area and stay in the loop on what their friends and communities around them are doing.

### **Solution Approach**
There is many things that are app does that brings great benefit to Muslims and Muslim Organizations. Muslims benefit from this app by being able to easily find events and communities in their area, as well as be able to see what events their friends are planning to go to due to our story feature. When people recognize one of their friends is going to an event, it incentives them to go to the event as well.

This is not only beneficial for the muslims to strengthen our bond with one another, but it's beneficial to the Muslim Community at large! Muslim Organizations can get a higher outreach, better statistics on how many people are attending, and can even have an easy way to advertise from a fundraiser/donation drive
